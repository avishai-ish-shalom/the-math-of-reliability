# The Math of Reliability

This is a introduction lecture to mathematical models related to reliability of IT systems.
The idea behind this talk is to promote the use of formal models for reliability and to teach about common (mis)conceptions around reliability.

This repository contains both the lecture slides (`index.html` - using reveal.js. click [here](http://blog.nukemberg.com/the-math-of-reliability/) to view) and a companion [Jupyter notebook](reliability.ipynb).
